TL;DR: Plagiarism has become a problem that is very well known throughout the schooling scene with students and teachers/professors alike. The true culprit behind its increase is the growth of technology and the Internet. We can fix this with certain solutions that need to be spearheaded by teachers and school administrations.

In the wake of the growth of plagiarism and its increasing occurrence by students, an argument has formulated between people who believe that technology has made plagiarism harder and others who believe that it has made it harder. There is no doubt that the wide availability of material and works which students can easily access, and even copy and paste, has made plagiarism a much easier proposition. Now while there may be a few objections to my claim, none usurp the fact that plagiarism would be much more difficult and tasking if the Internet did not exist.

Like I said before, there are objections and people who claim that technology advances have made plagiarism harder for students. Possibly the biggest of these claims, and probably the most relevant one, is the arrival of websites that check works for plagiarism. The most prominent example is turnitin.com. Websites like these use complicated algorithms that check all other works on the Internet for material that is the same as in the work the student handed in. They have even become so efficient that students have tried to trick them and failed. One example of this is a student changing all of the e's in their work to italic. The algorithms have figured this out and have made it almost impossible to trick. I believe that my objectors have some merit with this argument, however the fact is that schools are not using websites like these nearly enough. Another objection is simply that since the plagiarism problem has grown so prominent and everyone has heard about it, that is harder than ever to get away with. I also have to refute this point because again,
