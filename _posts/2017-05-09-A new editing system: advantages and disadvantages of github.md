TL;DR: Like with any user interface or publishing software, there are some advantages and disadvantages to using GitHub and Markdown to publish articles. I however, have found these two services to be very useful and innovative during this semester.

When I learned that we were going to be using this system of editing and publishing that I had never used before, I was definitely skeptical. However, after using GitHub and Markdown to publish my mobile-ready articles, I have been very happy with how they have been of use to me. The ability to revise through the issue-tracker and Markdown's simple and easy-to-understand layout has made my experience this spring very enjoyable. I look forward to hopefully using this software in the future.

TL;DR: Likewise, there are advantages and disadvantages to using GitHub and Reveal.js to prepare and deliver mobile-ready presentations. I have found my experience to be slightly less enjoyable with this side of the course.

By using GitHub and Reveal.js to create our presentations, I was introduced to an entire new way to create slides. By actually coding the slides, we were able to put our presentations on our mobile-ready websites and access them there. Like with the articles, the ability to revise with my editor was very useful. However, I found the coding to be a little time consuming and not as engaging or easy as something such as Microsoft PowerPoint where I feel you have more freedom. Overall, I would say my experience with the production of slides using these programs to be average with some advantages and disadvantages.
