TL;DR: The world of piracy has never had a more prominent place or played a bigger role in the technology universe than it does today. I have interviewed an anonymous (for safety reasons) colleague of mine about their experiences in this topic.

1. What does the word "piracy" mean to you?

2. What kind of effect do you think piracy has on the consumer?

3. Likewise, what kind of effect do you think piracy has on the creator, or the one who's work is being stolen or copied?

4. What differences do you think there are between movie and music piracy?

5. Although not a huge topic that is discussed, there is also the possibility of textbook piracy in which students can gain free access to textbooks and/or answers. Do you think this is a problem or do you think it is just beneficial to students in their thirst for knowledge?

6. What are your experiences with piracy firsthand (if you have any)?

7. Do you think that piracy is worth the risk of possible legal consequences and/or viruses it can cause on your devices?

8. What do you think people who rely on piracy in order for certain material can turn to as an alternative?

9. What do you think law enforcement can do to better monitor piracy situations?

10. Past research has indicated that men commit more property crimes and violent offenses than women (Greenfield & Snell, 2000). A sex difference has also been reported in software piracy (Hagan & Kay, 1990; Hollinger, 1993). Hollinger reported that for every woman, three men are likely to engage in software piracy. Why do you think that this is?
