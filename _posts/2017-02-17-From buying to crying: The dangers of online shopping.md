TL;DR: People nowadays have become victims to the online shopping trend. This has resulted in excess and unnecessary spending that would most likely not have taken place without the temptation of shopping on the Internet.

It is basic human nature. Everyone wants to be able to spend unlimited amounts of money and "shop till you drop." However, as this is obviously not plausible, a very common struggle for people today is being smart with and conserving their money. People are always trying to stick to a budget and put their earnings away into savings. Another growing trend is also online shopping. With the emergence of online shopping, it has become easier than ever before to search for things you want and in turn ordering them to have on your doorstep within days. The negative secret behind this however, is starting to be unearthed.
